<p align="center">
  <img alt="STOMT Unreal Engine feedback integration" src="http://schukies.io/images/stomt/StomtUnrealWidget_9-2017.PNG" />
</p>

This SDK allows the easy integration of the feedback solution [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/) in your Unreal apps and games.

[Unreal Engine Wiki Page](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/STOMT_Plugin)

## Why?

STOMT allows you to collect simple and constructive feedback in-game and [also from your website](https://stomt.co/web) and collect it at one central place where you manage it and where your community can vote and comment on the feedback of others. (see [use cases](#use-cases) below)


## Features

* Collect constructive feedback in-game
* Append error-logs
* Label the feedback automatically (e.g. with the game version number)
* All feedback is collected at your STOMT profile ([Example](https://www.stomt.com/empires-of-the-undergrowth)) where you can manage and react to the feedback
* Login with a STOMT account or anonymously
* Leave E-Mail after writing a stomt
* Persistent Login across all Unreal games


## Use-Cases

_What will the result look like?_ 

Example Games that use our widget:

* [Empires of the Undergrowth](https://www.stomt.com/empires-of-the-undergrowth)      
* [All Walls Must Fall](https://www.stomt.com/AWMF)


## Installation

This repository contains a complete Unreal-Project with the STOMT plugin already integrated. 
Use it as example and integrate the plugin into your game by following the steps below.

_If you use an older Unreal Engine version please check out the `UE/[version]` branch._

1. Clone or download this repository to a folder.

2. Copy the `/Plugins/StomtPlugin` folder from the repository into your project `Plugins` directory. 

3. **If you do not use C++ code in project:** use the Add New button in the editor and add a blank C++ class to your project.

4. Add the StomtPlugin to your projects PublicDependencyModuleNames in the projects build.cs.

`/Source/[YourProjectName]/[YourProjectName].Build.cs`:
```c++
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "StomtPlugin" }); // Add "StomtPlugin" String
```

5. Copy `/Content/Stomt` folder from the repository into your project `Content` folder.

6. Place the `StomtActor` in your scene and press play. (Press 'E' to toggle the widget on/off)

You can enter the configuration directly into the blueprint or access the variables.
