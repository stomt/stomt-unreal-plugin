# STOMT Unreal-SDK [![Stomt API](https://img.shields.io/badge/stomt-v2.4.X-brightgreen.svg)](https://rest.stomt.com/)

<img alt="STOMT Unreal Engine feedback integration" src="http://schukies.io/images/stomt/StomtUnrealWidget_5-2017.PNG" />

This SDK allows the easy integration of the feedback solution [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/) in your Unreal apps and games.

## Why?

STOMT allows you to collect simple and constructive feedback in-game and [also from your website](https://github.com/stomt/stomt-javascript-sdk) and collect it at one central place where you manage it and where your community can vote and comment on the feedback of others. (see use-cases below)

## Features

* Collect constructive feedback in-game
* Append error-logs
* Label the feedback automatically (e.g. with the game version number)
* All feedback is collected at your STOMT profile ([Example](https://www.stomt.com/empires-of-the-undergrowth)) where you can manage and react to the feedback
