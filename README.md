1. Clone or download this repository into your projects `Plugins` directory.

1.2. **If you do not use C++ code in project:** use the `Add New` button in the editor and add a blank C++ class to your project.
[Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/QuickStart/2/index.html)

2. Add the StomtPlugin to your projects `PublicDependencyModuleNames` in the projects `build.cs`. `/Source/[YourProjectName]/[YourProjectName].Build.cs`:
```c++
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "StomtPlugin" }); // Add "StomtPlugin" String
```

3. Restart Unreal Editor, open your project and enable the plugin. `Edit -> Plugins -> Widgets -> StomtPlugin`

## Configuration

1. Create a page for your game on [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/signup/game).

2. Create an [App Id](https://www.stomt.com/integrate) for Unreal.

3. Enter the `App Id` into the `ExampleActor` Blueprint:

**You can disable the screenshot and log-upload functionality**

4. Add the `StomtWidgetBP` to the viewport via script (`ExampleActor`) or in your main HUD (`ExampleUI`) as widget.


## Form Triggers

The widget can be opened and closed whenever you want by using our trigger functions.     
    
That allows you to:    
* Put a button into the main menu [(Example)](https://imgur.com/5SoQzfj)
* Put a button into the HUD [(Example)](https://imgur.com/t9wPpJj)
* Only show the button to certain players (e.g. power users)
* Trigger the form after certain events

**Define a hotkey:**

## Event-Callbacks

The STOMT Widget supports a variety of callback events.

## In-Game Labeling

Labels will help you track down user issues.
Append labels, as for example your game-version or the player position/level. You can either hardcode them in the Unity Inspector or use a script to add them in a flexible way based on the information you have.
